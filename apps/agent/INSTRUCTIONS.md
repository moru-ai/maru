# Agent Environment

## File Storage

When creating files, prefer using `/workspace` directory or its subdirectories instead of `/tmp`.

- `/workspace` - Primary working directory for all file operations
- `/workspace/output` - For generated outputs
- `/workspace/data` - For data files

Avoid using `/tmp` unless absolutely necessary for temporary system operations.
